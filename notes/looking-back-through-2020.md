> 2020 - a year in which many of us reflected on who we are, how we spend our time, and what is our place in our communities.

One of the things I started this year was [writing a bit](https://notes.ryanparag.com/notes) - so why not write a year-in-review for 2020.

While many things this year were tumultuous, I was able to focus on a plethora of things that I may have never done. I spent alot of time walking/biking outside, listening to podcasts, learning new things, working on side projects, and spending time with those close to me.

### Work

Professionally, this was a great year (and my 2nd year) at my [day job](https://ryanparag.com/work/masonite). Although many companies and individuals went through difficult times at different times in 2020, we were lucky enough to be in an industry that didn't have a heavy, negative economic downturn.

At the beginning of this year, my team began a [few new cutting-edge projects](https://ryanparag.com/work/masonite) and ended the year shipping v1's on all of them 🙌! While starting the year off with a handful of high-impact projects, we also fulfilled the need to scale the size of our team by 1.5x. We spent a ton of time:
- Learning how digital tools can help bridge gaps between homeowners and contractors
- Understanding a user's relationship between an app and a hardware products
- Seeing how we can better inform/teach users on how to install home hardware products in the post-COVID-19 DIY age.

I chose not to freelance too much this year, but I did choose to help out designing for a company called [SoleVenture](https://www.soleventure.com/). Learning how to ship a cross-platform product as well as find where freelancers see value in their benefits was eye-opening.

### Portfolio and Blog

In late 2019, I began rebuilding my portfolio with `React/Gatsby` and was able to [get it live](https://ryanparag.com) in February - continuing to make small edits throughout the year!. Looking back on some of the quirks with `Gatsby`, I probably should have built it using `Next.js` from the start - *but it's been a great learning experience!*

At the beginning of this year, I wanted to start writing and sharing the things I'm working on in the open - so I [built and iterated on this site](https://notes.ryanparag.com). In fact, this site is not only a space for my writing, but also a place where I can experiment on new ideas I have: [Theme Creator](https://notes.ryanparag.com/create-theme), `Next.js`, design system stuff, etc.

Using something like `Next.js` helps me iterate and deliver ideas more quickly and flexibly - easy-to-use, quick build times, package support, etc.

### Side Projects

I spent a bit of time rebuilding [Slack Themes](https://slack-themes.now.sh/) this year and had a ton of fun implementing a few new, fun things into the updated version (Firebase, theme submission, Theme Admin, etc.). In fact, [another designer](https://matt-broughton.com/) jumped on board the project too. We've got some things cooking for this project this year!

The abrupt nature of this year caused a bit of disruption in how designers in the area could connect with each other - as well as how new designers in the area could connect with one of the many local design organizations. To help consolidate that information into a single space, I threw together [TampaBay.design](https://tampabay.design) - designers could join the different Slack communities and see which virtual events were being hosted by the local design orgs.

> I'll be iterating on these project alot more through 2021, and possibly starting a few others 😉.

### Learning

Every year I tell myself I'm going to learn something new to aid in my design skills. However, this year I couldn't use my usual excuse of not having the time 🤦‍♀️. One of the benefits of 2020 was that I stayed at my desk a bit more, going through:
- [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
- Learning Firebase
- Building a few Figma plugins to help with our design workflow at work
- Picking up a bit of 3D modeling with Blender and Spline.
- (Re)learning bits of Python

> Some of these new learnings are leaking their way into some of my recent designs, but I fully expect the rest to make an entrance in 2021!

### Extracurricular

Beside design/work stuff, I spent a ton of time picking up a few new things to help me spend my time more meaningfully, or even to help me "slow down and smell the roses". I picked up my dusty acoustic guitar more than I had in the past few years, and subsequently fell in love learning a bit of practical music theory.

One thing I never thought I would start is going to racing school 🚗. Growing up as an avid Gran Turismo fan, the itch to get behind a steering wheel of a car on the track never seemed real. I had no idea what to expect, but I signed up for a 3-day racing school in January and it was more thrilling than I could've hoped. While I'm no Alain Prost in a Miata, it transformed the way I drive and helped me think about something as high-octane as racing in a more strategic way.

While stuck at home at the beginning of the year, I realized I could explore my locale further if I had a bike - so I went full-purist and picked up a [fixed-gear bike](http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/mercier/images/kilot_tt_pro_gray_chrome_xi_2100.jpg). After doing of bit info digging before-hand, I thought to dive down the fixie route due to the DIY nature of it all - it's been great and I've been tracking my rides around town through Strava!

I also spent a bunch of time walking around town and listening to a ton of podcasts - while journeying from point A to point B. My podcast genres run fairly wide - from the music industry, to news, to design, to healthcare, etc. If you're curious, some of my favorite podcasts were:
- [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace/)
- [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast)
- [Ted Talks Daily](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-talks/ted-talks-daily)
- [NPR's Throughline](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510333/throughline)
- [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts)
- [Tradeoffs](https://tradeoffs.org/)
- and a bunch more - ping me in the form below if you'd like to get the full list!

2020 also bit me with the coffee bug. Before this past year, I would drink 3 - 5 cups of coffee from wherever, keurig machines, coffee shops, the beat-up coffee machine. Around March, I decided to level-up my coffee game - you know the drill, chemex, gooseneck kettle, coffee grinder, local-roasted beans, etc. Who knows what 2021 has in store for my coffee addiction? Espresso machine ☕️?

> So drinking more coffee, going on long bike rides, learning how to race cars - a strange way to sum up a few new hobbies I picked up in 2020.

### What to expect for 2021

This year was a whirlwind for everyone of us, in many different ways - from working/learning from home to personal relationships, we all spent some much needed time recalibrating.

In 2021, I want to *focus on adding more interactivity to this site, my portfolio, and my side projects*. Having others interact with the content is way more interesting and meaningful than throwing together a simple, static website.

*I also want to write (alot) more than I did this past year*. Starting off with this post, I hope to increase my cadence to ~1 post week, and see which content connects.

As far as extracurricular stuff, I'll probably continue all of the awesome things I picked up in 2020. On top of that, I've been thinking about *learning how to ride a motorcycle* and possibly learning how to modify a cheap project bike!

**I hope your 2020 was meaningful and that you have a great 2021 🎉!**
